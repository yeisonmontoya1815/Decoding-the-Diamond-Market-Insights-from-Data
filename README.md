# 💎 Diamond Price Analysis Project

## 📜 Project Description

The value of a diamond is shaped by key factors such as carat weight, color grade, clarity, and cut quality. These attributes work together to determine the overall quality and market value of the diamond. In this project, we delve into a dataset of nearly 54,000 diamonds to better understand how these factors influence pricing.

### 🎯 Objectives

The main goals of this project are:
- To **explore** which attributes most significantly impact the price of diamonds.
- To **predict** the price of diamonds based on their various features using machine learning techniques.

## 📥 Inputs

This project utilizes a rich dataset with approximately 54,000 records of diamonds. Key features include:

- **Carat Weight** 🏋️: The weight of the diamond, a primary factor in its value.
- **Cut** ✂️: The quality of the diamond's cut, ranging from Fair to Excellent.
- **Color** 🌈: The diamond’s color grade, with D being colorless and J representing light yellow.
- **Clarity** 🔍: The clarity grade, from Flawless (FL) to Included (I1, I2, I3), indicating the presence of internal or external flaws.
- **Price** 💰: The market price of the diamond.
- **Additional attributes** like depth, table, and dimensions that also provide insights into diamond quality.

## 📚 Data Dictionary

### 🎨 Understanding Color Classification
- **Color** refers to the presence of color in the diamond, with D being the highest grade (colorless) and J being the lowest (light yellow). Colorless diamonds are typically more valuable.

### 🔬 Understanding Clarity Classification
- **Clarity** grades diamonds based on the absence of internal flaws (inclusions) or surface imperfections (blemishes). The higher the clarity (e.g., Flawless), the more valuable the diamond.

### 🔪 Understanding Cut Scale
- **Cut** describes how well a diamond has been shaped. The better the cut (e.g., Ideal, Excellent), the more brilliance and sparkle the diamond will exhibit, leading to higher value.

### ⚖️ Understanding Carat Weight
- **Carat** refers to the weight of the diamond, with higher carat weight typically corresponding to higher value. However, the price is also influenced by other attributes like cut and clarity.

## 📊 Data Analysis Steps

### 🧹 Data Cleaning

Before diving into analysis, we ensure the dataset is clean by handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and addressing outliers. This process prepares the data for deeper insights.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this phase, we investigate how different diamond attributes are distributed and how they relate to the price:

- **Categorical Variables**: We analyze how diamonds are distributed across **Cut**, **Color**, and **Clarity** categories.
- **Summary Statistics**: We explore statistics like the average price based on different cuts, lengths, widths, and depths to understand key price trends.
- **Correlation Analysis**: We evaluate the relationship between attributes and diamond price, identifying which features most significantly affect pricing.

## 📈 Predictive Modeling

### 📊 Multiple Linear Regression

We use **Multiple Linear Regression** to model the relationship between diamond attributes and price. By fitting the model on training data, we can predict the price of diamonds based on their features.

### 🔍 Lasso & Ridge Regression

To prevent overfitting, we apply **Lasso** and **Ridge** regression, both regularization techniques that help fine-tune the model for more accurate predictions.

### 🌳 Decision Tree

We also explore **Decision Tree** algorithms to categorize diamonds into different price categories. This method offers intuitive insights into which features lead to higher or lower diamond prices.

## 💡 Key Observations

- **Carat** weight and **Cut** quality play significant roles in determining the diamond’s price.
- **Clarity** and **Color** influence price, but not as strongly as Carat and Cut.
- **Multiple Linear Regression** provides a solid model for predicting diamond prices, but **Lasso** and **Ridge** regression help improve accuracy by minimizing overfitting.
- **Decision Trees** offer a clear understanding of how specific attributes contribute to pricing categories.
